I spent a total of 4 hours on the project broken up over two sections 
of 1 hour and 3 hours. I was not able to finish completely speccing 
the actual json requests to the full extent I would like so that it is 
probably the area I would like to spend more time on. 
If I were to put the product into production I would like to refactor 
some of the code. I believe there to be a better method of handling the 
dinosaurs and their species. I originally intended to use an sti for the 
dinosaurs and their species, but this didn't allow for easy assignment
of diet. Another area of area of expansion for the tool would be to 
include omnivorous dinosaurs or to be able to differentiate by habitat 
(land, sea, air). The application would also need to be movedd to a
multithreaded web server. Finally permissions or some form of 
authentication would need to be added as who would want anyone being 
able to move dinosaurs around.
